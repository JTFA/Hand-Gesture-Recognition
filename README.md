# Hand Gesture Recognition and object Recognition



communication’s the main channel between people to communicate with each other. In the recent years, there has been rapid increase in the number of deaf and dumb victims due to birth defects, accidents and oral diseases. Since deaf and dumb people cannot communicate with normal person so they have to depend on some sort of visual communication. There are many languages spoken all around the world and interpreted. “Special people”, that is people who have difficulty in speaking and hearing “The dumb” and “The deaf” people respectively find it difficult to understand what exactly the other person is trying to express and so with the deaf people. Sometimes people interpret these messages wrongly either through sign language or through lip reading or lip sync. This project is made in such a way to help these specially challenged people hold equal par in the society.
